# non-algo

Non-algorithmic mantras are phrases or affirmations that are intended to evoke deeper self-awareness, consciousness, and inner abilities without relying on computational algorithms to generate or understand them. They are typically crafted to resonate with human intuition, emotions, and consciousness, rather than following a systematic, rule-based approach typical of algorithms.
